# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

An interactive **Machine Learning web application** built with **Python** and **Streamlit** that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on four botanical measurements. The application uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the famous **Iris Dataset** from **scikit-learn** and saves the trained model using **Pickle**.
